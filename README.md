# rest-spring-boot-and-kotlin

Recently I started to focus on my career as backend developer, and I decided to learn Kotlin and Spring and let Node.js
for a little.

I already studied some fundamentals of Kotlin using LeetCode, but I like to learn using a real application.

So, I decided to create this project using Kotlin and Spring, and I'll use this repository to register my progress.

About the application... It's a simple REST API to manage some data, maybe with auth. I'll use Spring Web to create the
endpoints, for database I don't decided yet, but probably is going to be PostgresSQL.

What I've learned so far:

- How build a project, add new plugins and libs using maven (using command line or intelliG);
- IntelliG functionalities, using linux and windows integration with wls (that was terrible);
- Some fundamentals of Kotlin - syntax, conditionals, collections, looping structures, null safety (thx God!);
- Learn what's a data class and differences between java and kotlin;
- Annotated controllers handler methods with Spring Web, create methods using @PathVariable, @RequestParam and
  @RequestBody annotations;
-
